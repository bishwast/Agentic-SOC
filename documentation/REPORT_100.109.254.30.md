**Date:** 2026-02-21 20:55:12
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** MITIGATED (Simulation)

## 1. Executive Summary
On 2026-02-21, an automated brute-force attack was detected. The Agentic SOC system identified the threat and initiated an AI-driven investigation.

## 2. AI Analysis & Investigation Results
I am requesting that we BLOCK 100.109.254.30.

The IP address 100.109.254.30 does not have a reputation score due to the lack of available information, but this absence of data does not preclude me from recommending taking action against it.

Blocking this IP address will help prevent potential threats and mitigate any potential impact on our systems. I propose that the security engineer approve this request to block 100.109.254.30 immediately.

Mitigation Actions:

1. Add 100.109.254.30 to the block list for all affected systems.
2. Implement additional network traffic monitoring to detect and alert on suspicious activity from this IP address in the future.
3. Perform a thorough analysis of available information on this IP address, including any potential connections to known malicious actors or groups, to identify potential next steps.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Incident Commander

## 3. Proposed Remediation
The Incident Commander recommends a BLOCK on the source IP at the network perimeter.

SUBJECT: Request for Change - BLOCK or WATCH IP Address 1.2.3.4

After conducting a thorough analysis of the IP address 1.2.3.4 using the abuse_ipdb_check tool, I have determined that this IP address has a high reputation score indicating it is likely to be involved in malicious activities.

Based on this information, I propose that we BLOCK the IP address 1.2.3.4 from accessing our systems and network resources until further notice. This will help protect our systems and data from potential threats.

However, before making a final decision, I would like to request a formal approval for this action. I believe that it is essential to have your expert review of the IP address's reputation score and any additional context that may be relevant to our incident response.

Therefore, I am submitting a Request for Change (RFC) to BLOCK the IP address 1.2.3.4. Please let me know if you require any additional information or if you would like me to proceed with implementing this action.

Mitigation Proposal:

* Implement a network access control (NAC) policy that denies access to the IP address 1.2.3.4.
* Update our incident response plan to include procedures for monitoring and responding to potential threats from this IP address.
* Provide training to all personnel on the importance of monitoring and reporting suspicious network activity.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this request. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

Incident Commander

## 3. Proposed Remediation
The Incident Commander recommends a BLOCK on the source IP at the network perimeter.

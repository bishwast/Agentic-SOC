**Date:** 2026-02-21 21:30:28
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** MITIGATED (Simulation)

## 1. Executive Summary
On 2026-02-21, an automated brute-force attack was detected. The Agentic SOC system identified the threat and initiated an AI-driven investigation.

## 2. AI Analysis & Investigation Results
I am proposing a formal Request for Change (RFC) to BLOCK the IP address "1.2.3.4" based on the findings from the research report. The IP address has a reputation score of 68 out of 100, with 108 total reports indicating potential malicious activity.

The tactical goal for this incident is to mitigate the risk of Brute Force (T1110), which is indicated as a possible threat by the high reputation score and number of reports.

I am recommending that the security engineer approve the request to BLOCK the IP address "1.2.4" to prevent potential malicious activity. This will ensure that our system remains secure and protects against potential threats.

Please find below the formal RFC for approval:
